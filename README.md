# **Implementation of ML Model for Image Classification**

This project is a simple and interactive **Streamlit app** that allows users to classify images using two pre-trained models: **MobileNetV2** and a custom **CIFAR-10 model**. Users can upload images and get predictions with confidence scores, making it both educational and practical.

---

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Dual Model Support**
- **MobileNetV2 (ImageNet)**: A powerful model trained on the ImageNet dataset to recognize 1,000 different classes, such as animals, objects, and vehicles.
- **Custom CIFAR-10 Model**: Focuses on classifying images into 10 specific categories like airplanes, cars, and birds.

### 2. **User-Friendly Interface**
- **Navigation Bar**: Easily switch between models using a sidebar menu.
- **Real-Time Results**: Upload an image, and the app instantly displays predictions with confidence scores.

### 3. **Perfect for Learning**
- Great for understanding how deep learning models work.
- Can be used for hands-on exploration of image classification.
